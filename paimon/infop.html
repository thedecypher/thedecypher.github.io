Paimon is the 9. soul. He's a great king who has a eternal devotion to Lucifer.
He is seen while sitting on an one-humped camel with a vitory crown on his head.
Some of his men walks with various musical instruments. He has a great and
terrible voice. Even magicians can't understand his words, they just feel
them. Paimon can teach all kind of arts, sciences and secret things.
He knows what the earth is, where the waters stand on, what and where the
intelligence is and where the wishes begin. He has a honour rank.
He can transform any of his men to a magician. He also has good kinds of knowledge.
Souls, which are under the influence of him, have 200 legions. Some of them
are armies of angels and the others are kings. Now the worst soul, Paimon, 
is alone. Two kings named Labal and Abalim joined him. They have some 
kings and 25 legions. This souls are Paimon's, unless the magician don't
himper them.
